# PHIEL
PHIEL (Private Health Information Electronic Locker) is a behavioral health electronic medical record specifically designed for mental health therapists working in a private practice setting that I independently designed and developer for my apprenticeship at Nashville Software School.  It provides a system for managing supervisors, therapists, clients, and appointment.  It also provides a system to document client notes.
